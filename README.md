## [ID2201 - Distributed Systems, Basic Course](https://github.com/Eugenius0/Distributed-Systems-Basic-Course-ID2201)

### Course contents
The course covers basic models for distributed systems, interprocess communication and how one handles synchronisation, consistency, replication, fault tolerance and safety in a distributed system. The course consists of a series of lectures and seminars that include practical assignments. Programming assignments illustrate problems in the course.

### Intended learning outcomes

After the course, students should be able to:

- explain important properties of distributed systems
- describe architecture and logical model of a distributed system
- explain and compare strategies for interprocess communication
- explain and compare models for so-called “middleware”
- explain and compare naming services
- explain the concept of logical time
- use logical time to implement distributed algorithms.

## [ID2207 - Modern Methods in Software Engineering](https://github.com/Eugenius0/Modern-Methods-in-Software-Engineering-ID2207)

### Course contents
Introduction and basic concepts for software development. Abstraction/models and division. Life cycle for software. Unified process. Unified Modeling Language (UML) Specification and analysis of requirements. System design. Object design. Design patterns: Refactoring. Transformation of models to code. Testing. Agile software development and agil emodelling. The bases of extreme programming. DevOps methods.

The practical part of the course contains exercises and a small software development project.

### Intended learning outcomes
Having passed the course, the student should be able to:

- formulate definitions of the most important concepts and the methods in software development
- evaluate and use the most important concepts and the methods in software development.

## [ID2203 - Distributed Systems, Advanced Course](https://github.com/Eugenius0/Distributed-Systems-Advanced-Course-ID2203)

### Course contents

Topics:

- Models of distributed algorithms
- Event-based programming
- Failure detectors and leader elections
- Reliable broadcast and epdimic algorithms
- Shared memory models
- Consensus and agreement
- Group communication and view synchrony
- Stabilization algorithms
- Impossibility proofs

### Intended learning outcomes
The course complements Distributed Systems, Basic Course, and prepares the students for M.Sc projects, and Ph.D. studies in the area of distributed systems.

The main objective of this course is to provide the students with a solid foundation for understanding, analyzing and designing distributed algorithms for reliable distributed systems.

More specifically after the course is completed the student will:

- Know how to specify the properties of distributed algorithms, so called liveness and safety properties.
- Explain the different models of distributed systems, including failure and timing models.
- Master basic algorithms for failure detection, leader elections, broadcast and multicast, basic shared memory in distributed systems, agreement protocols, and group communication.
- Practice in design and implementation of selected distributed algorithms in middleware designed for group communication.

## [DH2642 - Interaction-Programming-and-the-Dynamic-Web](https://github.com/Eugenius0/Interaction-Programming-and-the-Dynamic-Web-DH2642)

### Course contents
JavaScript for interaction programming, callbacks, synchronous and asynchronous code, functional programming.
Web development interfaces (API): REST, JSON, AJAX, Fetch, Promises.
Local data: cookies, local storage.
User interfaces, appearance: HTML, CSS, DOM API, other tree based frameworks for user interfaces (e g Android).
User interfaces, interaction: events, event levels, event propagation, event management.
User interfaces, architectures: Model-View-Controller.
User interfaces, frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.

### Intended learning outcomes
Having passed the course, the student will be able to

- choose appropriate technical platforms or JavaScript frameworks to create useful data persistent interactive web applications or native applications
- program interactive web applications according to Model-View-Controller or related architectures
- program systems that read data from, and send data to, web interfaces with good use qualities
- assess and improve the usability of existing interactive web applications
- cooperate with others to implement interactive web applications.
